## 🚀 Features

### 🎵 Local music playback

- Local music scanning, search, playback, and folder browsing.
- Search, sorting, fast indexing, and multi-select management for the dashboard home, album, folder, and artist pages.
- Album pages, artist pages, song lists, current queue, mini player, and immersive now-playing screen.
- CJK titles can participate in A-Z sorting through Latinized sort keys, with cached keys to reduce home-screen stalls.
- Library analytics for play-count ranking, listen-time ranking, format distribution, and quality distribution.

### 🖼 Now-playing and dynamic covers

- 1:1 top cover / video cover layout for the now-playing page.
- Dark dynamic flow background, with adaptive long-title sizing to preserve more full titles.
- Dynamic video covers can be searched from the current album folder, public Movies directory, and app-specific directories.
- Album-level video cover reuse is supported, so one video can be shared by multiple songs in the same album.
- Drag-down dismiss with animated top corner radius.
- Cover page, lyric page, and landscape lyric page.
- Mini lyrics show the previous, current, and next lines to make upcoming lyrics clearer.
- Bottom action menu, queue panel, playback mode switching, and progress control.

### 🎤 Lyric experience

- LRC, enhanced LRC, TTML, and Lyricify lyric parsing.
- Word-level lyrics, translations, romanization / pronunciation, background words, `x-bg` background vocals, and TTML duet layout.
- External LRC and embedded lyric reading.
- Fallback support for common Chinese lyric encodings.
- Sustain glow, continuous word-level sweep, wrapped-line progress, and click-to-seek.
- Improved TTML / Lyricify word tails, spaces, translations, original lines, and pronunciation detection to reduce missing words and line swaps.
- Custom lyric-page fonts from system-font previews or imported TTF / OTF / TTC files.

### 🪟 Desktop and system lyrics

- Desktop lyric floating overlay.
- Text-only desktop lyric style by default, without a large black card background.
- Text shadows improve readability on bright wallpapers.
- Double-tap controls, auto-hide, and screen-bounded dragging.
- Desktop lyric controls for play / pause, previous, next, font size, lock, and close.
- Lyricon Provider integration.
- SuperLyric, Flyme / AOSP ticker lyric notifications, and Bluetooth lyric support.
- Samsung floating lyric translation delivery, with better preservation of word spacing, tail words, and dual-line structure.

### 🌐 WebDAV, LX, and MusicFree online music

- WebDAV configuration, connection testing, remote directory browsing, and remote audio playback.
- WebDAV paths support Chinese characters, spaces, and other special characters, with folder-result caching.
- Multi-source LX Music API import and centralized source management.
- Import sources from URLs or local JS files.
- Online search, playback, artwork display, Kuwo lyric fetching, and downloads to `Music/Ella/`.
- MusicFree plugin management, plugin-hub imports, online search, lazy playback queues, and downloads.
- Online queues skip unplayable items to reduce playback interruptions.

- WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG, OPUS, and other audio tag reading.
- System, FFmpeg, and Auto decoder modes. FFmpeg is the default decoder mode.
- FFmpeg extension decoder improves compatibility for ALAC / M4A and other formats.

- Audio quality labels: Dolby Atmos, Dolby double-D, Master, Apple Lossless, Hi-Res, Lossless, HQ, and LQ.

## 📦 Download

Download the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella/releases).

Recommended first-time setup:

1. Install Ella Music.
2. Grant music file access permission.
3. Wait for the local music scan to complete.
4. Grant overlay permission if you want to use desktop lyrics.
5. Configure WebDAV if you use a remote music library.
6. Import LX Music API sources or MusicFree plugins if you need online music.
7. Enable Lyricon / SuperLyric / Ticker / Bluetooth lyric options as needed.

## 🖼 Dynamic video covers

Dynamic video covers are used by the top area of the immersive now-playing page. Album-level configuration is recommended:

```text
Music/Album Name/
├── cover.mp4
├── Song A.flac
├── Song B.flac
└── Song C.flac
```

All songs in the same album can share the same video, avoiding duplicate video files for each track.

Centralized management is also supported:

```text
Movies/Ella/DynamicCovers/
├── Album/
│   └── Album Name.mp4
├── Song/
│   └── Artist - Title.mp4
└── cover.mp4
```

The actual matching order follows the implementation: generally, Ella first checks the song's local folder, then song / album videos under DynamicCovers, and finally a global fallback video.

## 🛠 Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella.git
cd Ella
git clone https://github.com/compose-miuix-ui/miuix.git external/miuix
MIUIX_INCLUDED_BUILD_PATH="$PWD/external/miuix" ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -PellaAbi=arm64-v8a
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella.git
cd Ella
git clone https://github.com/compose-miuix-ui/miuix.git external/miuix
$env:MIUIX_INCLUDED_BUILD_PATH="$PWD\external\miuix"
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug -PellaAbi=arm64-v8a
```

Release builds first read the following environment variables:

```bash
RELEASE_STORE_FILE
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

If these variables are not set, the project-root `release.jks` will be used; when no release keystore is available, the release build falls back to the debug signing configuration.

## 🎧 FFmpeg

Prebuilt FFmpeg static libraries are included here:

```text
ffmpeg-decoder/src/main/jni/ffmpeg/android-libs
```

To rebuild them on Windows, run:

```powershell
.\build_ffmpeg.ps1
```

The script builds FFmpeg through WSL with the Linux Android NDK.
