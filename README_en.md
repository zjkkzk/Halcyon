## Native Build Notes

Ella packages prebuilt arm64-v8a native libraries by default. Normal `assembleDebug` / `assembleFastRelease` builds do not rebuild FFmpeg or lyrico-audiotag native code. The repository no longer keeps the full FFmpeg C source tree by default.

To restore or refresh native outputs, run these scripts manually:

- `.\scripts\download_ffmpeg_prebuilt.ps1`
- `.\build_ffmpeg.ps1`
- `.\build_lyrico_taglib.ps1`

`.\scripts\download_ffmpeg_prebuilt.ps1` restores the FFmpeg prebuilt inputs. `.\build_ffmpeg.ps1` pulls temporary source code on demand, rebuilds the static libraries and `libffmpegJNI.so`, then cleans the full source tree back down to the `include/android-libs` prebuilt inputs. The bundled native target is currently focused on `arm64-v8a`.

## ✨ Overview

**Ella Music** is an Android music player built with **Jetpack Compose, Miuix, and AndroidX Media3**.

It focuses on local music playback while integrating basic i18n, local playlists, WebDAV remote libraries, LX Music API online sources, LRC / Enhanced LRC / ELRC / TTML / Lyricify lyric parsing, dynamic playback pages, immersive player UI, floating desktop lyrics, Lyricon integration, SuperLyricApi lyric publishing, Lyric Getter API raw-lyric transmission, Flyme / AOSP ticker lyrics, Bluetooth lyrics, lyric card sharing, AI song interpretation, FFmpeg extended decoding, application logs, backup and restore, and music library analytics.

The overall UI and interaction design are inspired by **MIUI / HyperOS**, aiming to provide a lightweight, modern, lyric-focused music playback experience on Android.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎵 Local Music Playback

- Supports local music scanning, searching, playback, and folder browsing, with switching between Android media library scanning and custom folder scanning.
- The home dashboard, albums, folders, and artists pages support searching, sorting, fast indexing, and multi-selection management.
- Supports album pages, artist pages, song lists, the current playback queue, mini player, and immersive playback page.
- Supports local playlist import / export and is compatible with Salt Player playlists, M3U, and M3U8, with TXT / M3U export support.
- Custom playlists can create desktop shortcuts.
- Supports reading audio file rating tags and automatically generating a Five-Star Songs playlist.
- Album recognition considers both album name and album artist; when album artist is empty, it falls back to artist to avoid merging same-name albums or singles from different artists. Album details support disc grouping, track numbers, copyright display, and sorting by disc number / track number.
- Artist pages support songs, participated albums, and released albums tabs, and include album artists in the artist system.
- Supports browsing the music library by genre, year, composer, and lyricist, with configurable artist / genre separators and a do-not-split list.
- Year detail album layouts now match genre details with compact album rows, reducing large-cover loading stutter on entry.
- Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and other CJK titles can participate in A-Z sorting through romanized sort keys, with cached sort keys to reduce home page stutter.
- Supports music library analytics, including play count ranking, listening duration ranking, format distribution, and quality distribution.
- Fast scrollbars are draggable and optimized for initial-drag stutter and side effects, with consistent behavior across songs, albums, artists, and folders.

### 🖼 Playback Page & Dynamic Covers

- The top area of the playback page uses a 1:1 cover / video cover layout.
- Supports a dark dynamic flowing-light background, and long titles automatically scale down to preserve complete information.
- Dynamic video covers can be matched from the current album folder, public Movies directory, and app-specific directory.
- Supports album-level video cover reuse, allowing multiple songs in the same album to share one video.
- Supports pull-down-to-dismiss on the playback page; both pull-down and direct back navigation include translation, scale, background blur, and top corner radius animations.
- Provides a cover page, lyrics page, and landscape lyrics page.
- Mini lyrics show the previous, current, and next lines to reduce cases where lyrics are incorrectly treated as having no following line.
- Supports bottom action menus, playback queue panels, playback mode switching, and progress control.
- The lyrics page supports a safe depth effect: distant lines scale down, fade, and blur slightly without strong per-line 3D rotation that can clip text.

### 🎤 Lyric Experience

- Supports LRC, Enhanced LRC, ELRC, TTML, and Lyricify lyric parsing.
- Supports word-by-word lyrics, translations, romanization / pronunciation, background words, `x-bg` background vocals, TTML duet layouts, and ELRC V1/V2 duet tags.
- Supports reading external LRC files and embedded lyrics.
- Provides fallback compatibility for common Chinese lyric encodings.
- Supports sustained glow, continuous word-by-word sweep, line-break lyric progress, tapping lyrics to seek, and double-tapping lyrics to play / pause.
- Word-by-word lyrics keep the current character clearly highlighted; short characters avoid wide feathered sweep effects that can cause blurring.
- Improves TTML / Lyricify recognition for word-by-word endings, spaces, translations, original text, and annotations, reducing missing words and line-position mismatches.
- ELRC V1/V2 duet information is passed to Lyricon / lyric barrage for left-right display.
- Supports long-press lyric selection for generating lyric cards, with customizable by information in app preferences.
- The lyrics page font can be selected from system font previews or imported from TTF / OTF / TTC font files.

### 🪟 Floating Lyrics & System Lyrics

- Supports a floating desktop lyrics window.
- Supports shadow strength and color switching; text shadows improve readability on bright wallpapers.
- Supports double-tap controls, hide-when-paused, auto-hide, and dragging constrained within the screen bounds.
- Floating lyrics controls include play / pause, previous track, next track, font size, lock, and close.
- Floating status-bar lyrics support top offset, safe-area / cutout avoidance, hide-when-paused, left / center / right placement, and secondary-line modes: off / translation / pronunciation.
- Supports lyric barrage.
- Supports publishing lyric data to the SuperLyric ecosystem through SuperLyricApi.
- Supports passing raw lyric text through the Lyric Getter API.
- Supports Flyme / AOSP ticker lyrics notifications and Bluetooth lyrics.
- Supports passing translations to Samsung floating lyrics while preserving word-by-word spacing, trailing words, and dual-line display structure as much as possible.

### 🌐 WebDAV & LX Online Music

- Supports WebDAV configuration, Digest authentication, connection testing, remote directory browsing, and remote audio playback.
- The WebDAV entry is located in the home page online music area for convenient access alongside LX Music.
- Supports importing and centrally managing multiple LX Music API sources.
- Supports importing sources from URLs or local JS files.
- Supports online search, online playback, cover display, lyric retrieval, and downloads to `Music/Ella/`.
- Online queues skip unplayable items to reduce playback interruptions.

### 🎚 Playback, Decoding & Audio Quality

- Local audio tag reading now uses lyrico-audiotag as the primary path.
- Supports reading covers, basic tags, and embedded lyrics from WAV, FLAC, M4A, ALAC, MP3, OGG, OPUS, and related formats, with fallback fixes for garbled tags.
- Provides system decoding, FFmpeg decoding, and automatic decoding modes. Automatic decoding is used by default; switch to the FFmpeg decoder if a file cannot be decoded.
- The FFmpeg extended decoder improves compatibility with ALAC / AAC and other M4A formats.
- Supports ReplayGain volume normalization.
- Supports sleep timer, stop after current track, playback speed, pitch control, queue clearing, disabling audio focus, and shuffle settings.
- Supports audio output switching, an option for the previous button to replay the current song, and listening history grouped by date.
- Supports displaying Dolby Atmos, Master, Apple Lossless, Hi-Res, Lossless, HQ, LQ, and other quality labels.
- *Specifications such as 24-bit / 96 kHz in music library lists are unified into the Hi-Res (MQ) system.*
- Fixes WAV notification artwork, album-page cover quality, stale media-notification metadata/artwork, and blank fallback covers for songs without embedded artwork.
- Fixes 163 key reading from standalone tags and from Comment / Description fields; comment display is compatible with both Comment and Description.
- Improves metadata fallback and quality recognition for WAV, ALAC / M4A, 24-bit / 96 kHz, and related formats.

### 🎨 UI & Settings

- MIUI / HyperOS-style settings pages and UI components based on Miuix.
- Basic i18n has been added with English resources for selected high-frequency screens.
- Uses a floating bottom navigation bar by default, allowing direct switching between the home, music library, and settings pages; it supports an expanded dual-bar dock and a compact dock after scrolling.
- The bottom dock and MiniPlayer can switch between Gaussian blur and Liquid Glass effects.
- Music library search, sorting, and multi-selection states prioritize closing the current state when the Back button is pressed.
- All major song lists use a unified more menu, song information, add to playlist, play next, share, edit tags, and delete actions.
- MiniPlayer covers automatically rotate during playback and support a cover-rotation toggle, lyric-display toggle, circular progress, and song / lyric switching animations.
- Album and artist detail pages provide large titles, gradient backgrounds, and unified information layouts.
- Supports theme switching and common playback, lyrics, scanning, decoder, external music tag scraping software, and lyric timing software settings.
- Supports a GitHub software update page, app log viewer, Logcat / network log collection, copying / sending detailed logs, automatic log retention, and app data backup; the update page no longer opens APK downloads when already up to date.
- Supports Shortcuts, with default entries for the music library, playlists, and folders.
- Notifications / control-center controls include favorite and playback-mode buttons through MediaSession custom commands.
- Song information pages support viewing audio tags, modified time, added time, 163 key decryption information, alias / comment, and jumping to NetEase Cloud Music song, album, or artist pages.
- Supports AI interpretation generated from song information and lyrics through OpenAI-compatible APIs.

## 📦 Download

Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella/releases).

Recommended first-time setup:

1. Install Ella Music.
2. Grant music file access permission and choose a scanning mode (media library scanning or custom folder scanning).
3. After scanning completes, the app is ready to use. To display lyrics on other pages, enable the option in the settings page.
4. Configure WebDAV manually if using a remote library.
---

## 🖼 Dynamic Video Covers

Dynamic video covers are used in the playback page cover area. Album-level configuration is recommended:

```text
Music/
├── Album Name.mp4
├── Song A.flac
├── Song B.flac
└── Song C.flac
```

or
```text
Music/Album Name Folder/
├── cover.mp4
├── Song A.flac
├── Song B.flac
└── Song C.flac
```

All songs in the same album can share the same video, avoiding duplicate video files for each song.

Centralized management is supported:

```text
Movies/Ella/DynamicCovers/
├── Album/
│   └── Album Name.mp4
├── Song/
│   └── Artist - Title.mp4
└── cover.mp4
```

Single-file configuration is also supported:
```text
Music/Song File Name.m4a
Music/Song File Name.mp4
```

Actual matching order depends on the implementation: it usually checks the song's local folder first, then checks DynamicCovers for song/album videos, and finally uses the global fallback video.

---

## 🛠 Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella.git
cd Ella
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -PellaAbi=arm64-v8a
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella.git
cd Ella
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug -PellaAbi=arm64-v8a
```

Release builds prioritize the following environment variables:

```bash
RELEASE_STORE_FILE
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

If these variables are not set, the build uses `release.jks` in the project root. If no usable release keystore is available, the release build fails directly to avoid accidentally producing a release package signed with a debug key.

For daily development, use `assembleDebug` for validation. `fastRelease` / release builds are intended for release preparation only. Native libraries are packaged from prebuilt `.so` files by default; rerun the corresponding scripts only when updating FFmpeg or lyrico-audiotag native outputs. Push each completed commit to both GitHub and GitLab remotes.

---

## 🎧 Native Libraries

Prebuilt FFmpeg and lyrico-audiotag native libraries are located at:

```text
ffmpeg-decoder/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libffmpegJNI.so
lyrico-audiotag/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/liblyrico_taglib.so
```

To restore FFmpeg prebuilt inputs after a fresh clone, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\download_ffmpeg_prebuilt.ps1
```

To update FFmpeg native outputs manually on Windows, run:

```powershell
.\build_ffmpeg.ps1
```

To update the lyrico-audiotag / TagLib native output, run:

```powershell
.\build_lyrico_taglib.ps1
```

Normal `assembleDebug` builds do not rebuild native code by default. Before release, verify the APK contains the required arm64-v8a `.so` files. For routine builds, the full FFmpeg source tree is unnecessary.

`liblyrico_taglib.so` is the native tag read/write output from lyrico-audiotag.
