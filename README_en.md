## ✨ Overview

**Ella Music** is an Android music player built with **Jetpack Compose, Miuix, and AndroidX Media3**.

It focuses on local music playback while integrating WebDAV remote libraries, LX Music API and MusicFree online sources, LRC / Enhanced LRC / TTML / Lyricify lyric parsing, dynamic playback pages, immersive player UI, floating desktop lyrics, Lyricon integration, SuperLyric integration, Flyme / AOSP ticker lyrics, Bluetooth lyrics, FFmpeg extended decoding, application logs, backup & restore, and music library analytics.

The overall UI and interaction design are heavily inspired by **MIUI / HyperOS**, aiming to provide a lightweight, modern, lyric-focused music experience on Android.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎵 Local Music Playback

* Supports local music scanning, searching, playback, and folder browsing.
* Dashboard, albums, folders, and artists pages support searching, sorting, fast indexing, and multi-selection management.
* Includes album pages, artist pages, song lists, playback queue, mini player, and immersive playback page.
* Album recognition considers both album name and artist to avoid merging same-name albums from different artists.
* CJK titles (Chinese / Japanese / Korean) can participate in A-Z sorting through Latinized sort keys with caching to reduce homepage lag.
* Includes music library analytics such as play count ranking, listening duration ranking, format distribution, and quality distribution.

### 🖼 Playback UI & Dynamic Covers

* Playback page uses a 1:1 cover / video cover layout.
* Supports dynamic flowing backgrounds in dark mode.
* Long titles automatically scale down to preserve full information.
* Dynamic video covers can be matched from album folders, public Movies directories, and app-specific directories.
* Supports album-level video reuse across multiple tracks.
* Pull-down gesture and back navigation both include rounded corner transition animations.
* Provides cover page, lyric page, and landscape lyric page.

### 🎚 Playback, Decoding & Audio Quality

* Supports WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG, OPUS, and other metadata parsing.
* Provides system decoder, FFmpeg decoder, and automatic decoding modes.

### 🎨 UI & Settings

* Built with Miuix components inspired by MIUI / HyperOS.
* Uses a floating bottom navigation bar by default.
* MiniPlayer cover rotates automatically during playback and supports circular progress and song/lyric transition animations.

## 📦 Download

Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella/releases).

Recommended first-time setup:

1. Install Ella Music.
2. Grant music file access permission, or enable auto music scanning on startup in settings and reopen the app.
3. After scanning completes, the app is ready to use.
   To display lyrics on other pages, enable the corresponding option in settings.
4. Configure WebDAV manually if using remote libraries.
5. Import LX Music API sources or MusicFree plugins manually if online music is needed.
   No API sources or plugins are bundled with the app.

---

## 🖼 Dynamic Video Covers

Dynamic video covers are used in the immersive playback page header area.

Recommended album-level structure:

```text
Music/Album Name/
├── cover.mp4
├── Song A.flac
├── Song B.flac
└── Song C.flac
```

All songs in the same album can share one video.

Centralized management is also supported:

```text
Movies/Ella/DynamicCovers/
├── Album/
│   └── Album Name.mp4
├── Song/
│   └── Artist - Title.mp4
└── cover.mp4
```

Actual matching order depends on implementation details.
Typically, the app first checks the local song folder, then DynamicCovers song/album videos, and finally falls back to a global default video.

## 🛠 Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella.git
cd Ella
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -PellaAbi=arm64-v8a
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella.git
cd Ella
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug -PellaAbi=arm64-v8a
```

Release builds prioritize the following environment variables:

```bash
RELEASE_STORE_FILE
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

If these variables are not provided, the project will attempt to use `release.jks` in the repository root.
If no release keystore is available, release builds fail instead of producing a debug-signed release APK.

## 🎧 FFmpeg

Prebuilt FFmpeg static libraries are located at:

```text
ffmpeg-decoder/src/main/jni/ffmpeg/android-libs
```

To rebuild FFmpeg on Windows:

```powershell
.\build_ffmpeg.ps1
```

The script uses WSL and the Android NDK to build FFmpeg.
