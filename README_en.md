# Ella Music

A clean local music player built with Jetpack Compose, Miuix, and Media3, with UI and interaction details tuned for a MIUI/HyperOS-style experience.

Chinese documentation: [README.md](README.md)

## Features

- Local music scanning, search, playback, and folder browsing
- Album pages, song lists, mini player, and immersive now-playing screen
- LRC / enhanced LRC parsing with word-level lyric display
- External LRC and embedded lyric reading, including common Chinese lyric encoding fallbacks
- Lyricon provider support and AOSP ticker lyric notifications
- WAV, FLAC, M4A, OGG, OPUS, and other audio tag reading
- FFmpeg extension decoder for ALAC / M4A compatibility
- ReplayGain volume normalization
- Miuix settings, theme switching, and optional liquid glass bottom navigation

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Ella.git
cd Ella
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Prebuilt FFmpeg static libraries are stored in `ffmpeg-decoder/src/main/jni/ffmpeg/android-libs`. To rebuild them on Windows, run:

```powershell
.\build_ffmpeg.ps1
```

The script builds FFmpeg through WSL with the Linux Android NDK.
